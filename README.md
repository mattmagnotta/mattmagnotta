I am a software developer, designer, and [photographer](https://aqueous-gorge-46064.herokuapp.com/). I love working with React and Javascript. I'm passionate about photography and design and truly believe that learning never stops, programming is a journey, not a destination.

### My motto:
Desire, determination, passion, enjoyment. Don't give up... ever. Build lots of things. Read lots of things.

### Currently working at [AVB Marketing](https://www.avbmarketing.com/)
